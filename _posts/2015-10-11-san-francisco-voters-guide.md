title: San Francisco 2015 Inititive Voters Guide
---

For San Francisco residents voting in the fall 2015 election here is how I suggest you vote on the upcoming inititives. Please do vote, this election has
several important inititives that could set the cities future direction
on housing policy if passed.

I generally agree
with the [SPUR Voter Guide](http://www.spur.org/sites/default/files/publications_pdfs/SPUR_Voter_Guide_November_2015.pdf) on most points. Please refer to it if
you need more in-depth analysis than I'm providing below.

## Yes on A: Affordable Housing

## Yes on B: Paid Parental Leave for City Employees

## No on C: Expenditure Lobbyists

## Yes on D: Mission Rock
I'm upset that this is even a thing we vote on in San Francisco, but thanks to proposition <insert previous prop> that is where we are.

## No on E: Public Meetings

## No on F: Short-Term Residental Rentals
This is essentially doubling down on the local trend of trying to control
miss-alligned market incentives with ever increasing regulation. The local
problem with AirBnB is an interplay between strict rent control, making short
term rentals much more profitable than long term. Combined with the lack 
of enough hotels, or enough permits to build new hotels, in a city that
is a magnet for tourism, conferences, and business.

## No on G: Restrictions for CleanPowerSF
This pair of inititives is incredibly confusing.

## No on H: Defining Renewable Energy

## No on I: Mission Moratorium
Simply terrible policy. Preventing new housing in the mission will do the
opposite of what this inititives supporters intend. It will actually increase
prices in the Mission and create more incentive for evictions as wealthy
owners and tenenants outcompete the existing population.

## No on J: Legacy Business Preservation Fund

## Yes on K: Surplus Public Lands

## Julie Christiensen for D3 Supervisor
If you're in district 3, vote for Julie Christiensen for Supervisor.
