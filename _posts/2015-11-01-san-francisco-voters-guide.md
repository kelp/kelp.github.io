title: San Francisco Fall 2015 Voters Guide
---

For San Francisco residents voting in the fall 2015 election I've outlined how I suggest you vote.
This is a very important election for the city, with several important initiatives that could set the cities 
future direction on housing policy if passed. Initiatives A, D, F, I, J and K are all related to the same 
fundamental issue, which at it's core is simple, but it's causes are complex and nuanced. The fundamental issue is
lack of supply of housing and commercial real estate in a very desirable city.

For those interested in understanding how we got here, [What's the Matter With San Francisco](http://www.citylab.com/housing/2015/07/whats-the-matter-with-san-francisco/399506/) is a good place to start. Additionally, [Kim-Mai Cutler's](http://techcrunch.com/author/kim-mai-cutler/) epic [SF Housing](http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/sf-housing/) article goes
is also worth a read.

I generally agree
with the [SPUR Voter Guide](http://www.spur.org/sites/default/files/publications_pdfs/SPUR_Voter_Guide_November_2015.pdf) 
on most points. Please refer to it if you need more in-depth analysis than I'm providing below.  

## Yes on A: Affordable Housing
This is a bond to raise $310 million for subsidized housing in San Francisco. Given the [price of building a unit of 
housing in San Francisco](http://www.spur.org/publications/article/2014-02-11/real-costs-building-housing) you 
can easily do some napkin math to discover this is a drop in the bucket, and realize there is no amount of realistic
government spending that will get us out of this problem with subsidized housing. That said, so maintain a diversity
of income levels in this city over the long term, we need more subsidized housing. As it is [we lose it nearly as quickly as we build it.](http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/real-estate/2015/07/sf-affordable-housing-preservation-housing-report.html) I recommend you vote Yes on this initiative.

## Yes on B: Paid Parental Leave for City Employees
While I don't personally have the same passion for this issue as I do for housing issues, I do think it's the right
thing to do. My [employer](https://squareup.com/) already does this. I think the city should do. Vote Yes.

## No on C: Expenditure Lobbyists
I certainly think we need to find ways to limit the money influence on politics, just look at what is happening
in the race for District 3 Supervisor. Roughly [$200 per vote](http://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Special-interests-digging-deep-in-6594262.php) is being spent! That said, I'm not convinced this legislation is the right
thing to do. I believe it would make the job of great organizations like [SPUR](http://www.spur.org) more difficult, 
so I recommend voting No.

## Yes on D: Mission Rock
I'm upset that this is even a thing we vote on in San Francisco, I think this should be up to the planning 
commission to decide, but thanks to [Proposition B](http://ballotpedia.org/City_of_San_Francisco_Voter_Approval_of_Waterfront_Construction_Exceeding_Height_Limits_Initiative,_Proposition_B_(June_2014)) 
approved by voters in the June 2014 election, that's where we are. This project provides significant new housing,
building an entire new neighborhood, bring in many construction jobs, and be 40% affordable housing. It might block
some people's views of the bay. Please vote Yes.

## No on E: Public Meetings
I don't have very strong opinions on this one, but it generally seems like a burden on local government without
providing additional resources to shoulder that burden. When was the last time you had a worthwhile debate
online? Is that what we need to bring to local politics, that are already very contentious? Lets vote No.

## No on F: Short-Term Residential Rentals This is essentially doubling down on the local trend of trying to control
miss-aligned market incentives with ever increasing regulation. The local problem with AirBnB is an interplay 
between strict rent control, strong tenant protections, and very limited supply, making short term rentals much 
more profitable than long term. Combined with the lack of enough hotels, or enough permits to build new hotels, in 
a city that is a magnet for tourism, conferences, and business. That said, AirBnB and similar short term rental's are
probably making the cost of rents higher in San Francisco, but I don't think this legislation is the right way to fix it.
This [Medium Post](https://medium.com/@emeyerson/prop-f-is-worse-than-you-think-17e395ca8761#.i878uv88u) gets
to the core of the issue better than I could. Vote No.`

## No on G: Restrictions for CleanPowerSF
This pair of initiatives is incredibly confusing.

## No on H: Defining Renewable Energy

## No on I: Mission Moratorium
Simply terrible policy. Preventing new housing in the mission will do the opposite of what this 
initiatives supporters intend. It will actually increase prices in the Mission and create more 
incentive for evictions as wealthy owners and tenants out-compete the existing population.
SUPRs guide lays it out very clearly: 
> As the Mission’s own history has shown, failure to build new housing simply 
> increases the pressure on a popular neighborhood’s already limited housing stock. 
> The Mission became hyper-gentrified with virtually no new housing development for decades.

[Additionally](http://sf.curbed.com/archives/2015/09/10/mission_moratorium_likely_to_increase_rents_not_likely_to_stop_gentrification_says_sf_chief_economist.php):
> San Francisco's chief economist has found no evidence that a temporary moratorium on 
> market-rate construction in the Mission would do anything to stop evictions or slow gentrification

Vote No.

## No on J: Legacy Business Preservation Fund

## Yes on K: Surplus Public Lands

## Julie Christiensen for D3 Supervisor
If you're in district 3, vote for Julie Christiensen for Supervisor. As I write this at 
[Contraband Coffee](http://www.contrabandcoffeebar.com) there are people on most street corners holding 
"Vote for Peskin" signs and handing out flyers. Peskin represents the old school of San Francisco politics
that lead to this housing mess in the first place, and he's doubling down on the same policies. It's interesting
that this is the Progressive arm of San Francisco politics. The reality is it's about maintaining the status
quo, and actively fighting against change.

[The Chronical](http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Chronicle-recommends-Julie-Christensen-for-6544232.php) does a solid job of laying out the case for Julie Christiensen, and talks about some of their differences and [Peskin's history](http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Peskin-vs-City-Hall-What-s-different-since-6179308.php).

I believe Christiansen generally has a balanced and practical view, backing plans to build additional housing, and 
improve transit in the city. Peskin's rhetoric is all about affordability, but I don't believe his policies will
actually improve affordability for many. He has a history of fighting new development, which certainly helps
property values increase, but it doesn't help make a more affordable city.
