Formerly a Senior Engineering Manager at Square in San Francisco.  I built 
teams and infrastructure for the networks, datacenters, servers and 
offices that supported all of [Square](https://squareup.com/). 

Since then I've been taking some time off to to get out in nature, up and
down the coast, and a whole lot of snowboarding.

I also try to stay up on San Francisco politics, especially those related to housing production.

Besides technology, you'll find strong opinions about local politics, 
especially those about housing, and transportation.
