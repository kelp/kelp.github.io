Right now, an Engineering Manager in San Francisco.  Building 
teams and infrastructure for the networks, datacenters, servers and 
offices that support all of [Square](https://squareup.com/). In my 
spare time I lift weights, run, and attend the ocassional 
[Cars and Coffee](http://www.carsandcoffeesanfrancisco.com) or 
[PCA](https://www.pca.org) event.


Besides technology, you'll find strong opinions about local politics, 
especially those about housing, and transportation.
