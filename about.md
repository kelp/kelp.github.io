I lead the SRE team at [Segment](https://segment.com). Before that I built 
teams and infrastructure for the networks, datacenters, servers and offices 
that supported all of [Square](https://squareup.com/). 

I also hike and run in the summer, and snowboard in the winter. I spend
a fair amount of time in the Sierras.
