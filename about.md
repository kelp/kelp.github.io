Right now, an Engineering Manager in San Francisco.  Building 
teams and infrastructure for the networks, datacenters, servers and 
offices that support all of [Square](https://squareup.com/). In my 
spare time I lift weights, run, and try to get out in nature, up and
down the coast, and recnetly started snowbarding again, after a 15 year break.

Dues paying member of the EFF, ACLU, Sierra Club and SF Bike Coaltion.

Besides technology, you'll find strong opinions about local politics, 
especially those about housing, and transportation.
