# Some of the most impactful books I've read in recent years

I read a lot of these books over the past few years, but I really started
moving fast when I subscribed to [Audible.com](https://www.amazon.com/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00NB86OYE/?ref_=assoc_tag_ph_1485906643682&_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=pf4&tag=httpplekorg-20&linkId=2687b01ad25491ee76ffac66ac11c5dc)
and started listening to books on my walk to work. I found this especially
compelling for getting through books that had been long on my list, but
were hard to get through. I don't think I'd ever finished several on this
list if not for Audible.

* [Why Nations Fail](https://amzn.to/2GNJLV4) by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson.

The authors explain a relatively simple theory for why
some countries prosper and others stay poor. A centralized state, combined with
inclusive institutions allows for creative destruction, which leads to
economic growth and technological innovation. On the other hand, extractive
institutions centralize wealth, and prevent creative destruction, leaving the
overall society poorer.

* [The Righteous Mind](https://amzn.to/2EASbZO) by Jonathan Haidt.

While reading this book, my jaw dropped several times as it expanded
my understanding of politics. Haid developed and then explains a model for
the moral framework used by the left and the right in American politics. It
was incredibly illuminating in understanding the values of the Right.

* [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://amzn.to/2qrd2dl) by Daniel Kahneman.

_The_ book on cognitive psychology and behavioral economics.It will put to
rest any idea that humans are rational beings. Though there is a systematic
way that we operate, it is often irrational and loaded with cognitive bias.
These explained in detail, and once you've read this book, you'll see how
widely it's author, and his late collaborator Amos Tversky, are referenced in
the field.

* [Mans Search for Meaning](https://amzn.to/2GMNulD) by Viktor Frankl

A discussion on finding meaning in life, even in the worst of situations.
It helps to put things in perspective.

* [Nudge](https://amzn.to/2GM7VPP) by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein

Introduces the concept of
[Libertarian paternalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_paternalism)
a way of thinking about systems design to allow for choice, but provide a slight
"nudge" towards the most beneficial choice. Such as making retirement savings
like a 401k opt-out,
and automatically increasing contributions as income increases. I think these
can be applied to many areas. The core lesson is to be thoughtful about what
behavior you want to encourage and make that the default and simplest option.

* [Creativity Inc.](https://amzn.to/2v4V0Tt) by Ed Catmull

About as interesting and engaging as a management book can get. You're walked
through the history of Pixar, and how they evolved their processes over time
to consistently create excellent films, and encourage a creative culture with
high standards for quality. There were also some excellent anecdotes
about working with Steve Jobs.

* [Good to Great](https://amzn.to/2vaZp7J) by Jim Collins

The author and his team identified and then interviewed the executives at
some companies that went from good businesses to great businesses, and
attempted to tease out what made them different.

* [What Got You Here Won't Get You There](https://amzn.to/2JCDJEr) Marshall Goldsmith

The author is an executive coach and walks through clear examples of behaviors
that successful people often have that are holding them back from career
progression. Your past success can create a lot of positive feedback about
your behavior up to that point, and you can start to believe that is why you
were successful. But you may, in fact, have been successful in spite of that
behavior. This book makes you look hard at your behavior, and it will
also open your eyes to actions of others that are not serving them well.

* [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://amzn.to/2GRCwr0) Robert Pirsig

This is simply a work of genius. The discussions of philosophy and quality are
wonderful.

* [A Guide to the Good Life](https://amzn.to/2Hc9B4A) William Irvine

An introduction to Stoic philosophy, bringing it to a modern audience. This book
prompted me to go on and read Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus. The main lesson
is that the way you think about and judge your life and experiences shapes your
experience of them. You have some degree of choice in what and how you think
about things that happen. One can reduce the pain of adverse events by spending
conscious time considering the worst case scenario. Then when something
less bad plays out, you've already visualized a worse situation, so this
negative one is less bad.

* [Nonviolent Communication](https://amzn.to/2JzUeBf) Marshall Rosenberg

I had my reservations about this book, and it took me some time to actually
sit down and read it. I was worried that it was too touchy-feely, and the
community around it is one that I have trouble identifying with. However, the
content of the book is fantastic. It teaches you a framework for
understanding what is truly bothering others, while also communicating your
needs in away that people are more likely to be receptive to. I can't pretend
that I've learned all the lessons, but these methods are something to aspire to.

* [Deep Work](https://amzn.to/2Hnxh3n) Cal Newport

An antidote to our always distracted world. A discussion of how to have greater
impact by turning off distractions and doing real focused work.

* [The Rational Optimist](https://amzn.to/2HrrtGb) Matt Ridley

The author makes the case that social and technological progress is actually
making life much better for most of humanity. The objective numbers to show
this to be true and the author makes the case that it's mostly due to free
trade, capitalism, and creative destruction. I tend to agree with most
of his book, though he is a bit of a climate change skeptic, which I have
a harder time getting behind. The author isn't exactly skeptical of
human-caused climate change, but doubtful that it will have enough of a negative
impact to be worth the economic drain of reducing fossil fuel use. All that
aside, I've become more of a free trade capitalist, in part due to this book.

* [The Power of Habit](https://amzn.to/2qqHLHs) Charles Duhigg

This book will teach you how habits are formed, how they work, and how you can
create new positive habits, or break old harmful habits. It also introduces
the concept of keystone habit, one that will then lead to many other
habits. Such as starting a running habit, later leads to improving your diet
and becoming more health conscious.

* [Drive](https://amzn.to/2HoJTY2) Daniel Pink

Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose. These are the three things necessary to be satisfied
with your job or career. It also explains why financial bonuses aren't
effective motivators. They take an intrinsic motivation, such as doing excellent
work for your customers, and turn it into an extrinsic motivation, making more
money for yourself.

* [When](https://amzn.to/2qlU6wk) Daniel Pink

The importance of _when_ you do something. For example, our ability to perform
cognitively demanding tasks changes through the day. For many people, the
morning is the best time to do such things. Later in the day, performance
actually drops significantly. School children who take a standardized test
in the morning, significantly outperform children who take them in the afternoon.
Additionally, timing changes throughout life. People in their teens and early
20s perform better in the afternoon, where older adults do better in the
morning. This is why you'll often see younger employees trying to come into
work later in the day. You should probably let them if you want their best
performance. I would roll into work around noon for most of my early
20s. Now I normally get in by 9 or 9:30.

* [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://amzn.to/2Jz4sSi) Dale Carnegie

The classic that still holds up. It's written in a folksy way and some of the
examples are fairly dated, but in general, lots of good stuff about being more
likable. I gave a copy of this to a few teammates were where rough around the
edges when it came to interacting with other people, but who had a lot of
potential.

* [Sapiens](https://amzn.to/2He5PHI) by Yuval Noah Harari

A fascinating discussion of the evolution of Homo Sapiens up through the
scientific revolution.

* [Getting More](https://amzn.to/2GPJW24) by Stuart Diamond

I had the fortune of attending a small employer-sponsored class run by the
author. He walks through his system for negotiating with others, including
how to negotiate when the other party is negotiating in bad faith. He also
teaches simple tools for getting more out of day to day interactions. In
general, the lesson is to figure out what the other person wants and
values and trade based on that. Sometimes, or even often, it's not money.
And be nice to people, it goes a long way.
