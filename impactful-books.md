Some of the most impactful books I've read in recent years.

* [Why Nations Fail](https://amzn.to/2GNJLV4) by Daron Acemoglu and 
James Robinson. The authors explain a fairly simple theory for why 
some countries prosper and others stay poor. A centralized state, combined with
inclusive institutions allows for creative destruction, which leads to 
economic growth and technological innovation. On the other hand, extractive
institutions centralize wealth, and prevent creative destruction, leaving the
overall society poorer.
* [The righteous Mind](https://amzn.to/2EASbZO) by Jonathan Haidt
While reading this book, my jaw litterally dropped several times as it expanded
my understanding of politics. Haid developed and then explains a model for
the moral framework used by the left and the right in American politics. It
was incredibly illuminating in understanding the values of the right.
* [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://amzn.to/2qrd2dl) by Daniel Kahneman
This is the book on cognitive psychology and behavior economics.It will put to
rest any idea that humans are rational beings. Though there is a systematic
way that we operate, it is often irrational and loaded with cognitive bias.
These explained in detail, and once you've read this book, you'll see how
widely it's author, and his late collaborator Amos Tversky, are referenced in
the field.
* [Mans Search for Meaning](https://amzn.to/2GMNulD) by Viktor Frankl
A discussion on finding meaning in life, even in the worst of situations.
It really helps to put things in perspective.
* [Nudge](https://amzn.to/2GM7VPP) by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein
Introduces the concept of [Libertarian paternalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_paternalism) a way of thinking about
systems design to allow for choice, but provide a slight "nudge" towards the
most beneficial choice. Such as making a retirement savings like a 401k opt-out,
and automatically increasing contributions as income increases. I think these
can be applied to many areas. The core lesson is to be thoughtful about what
behavior you want to encourage, and make that the default and easiest option.
* [Creativity Inc.](https://amzn.to/2v4V0Tt) by Ed Catmull
About as interesting and engaging as a management book can get. You're walked
through the history of Pixar, and how they evolved their processes overtime
to consistently create excellent films, and encourage a creative culture with
high standards for quality. There were also a number of excellent annecdotes
about working with Steve Jobs.
* [Good to Great](https://amzn.to/2vaZp7J) by Jim Collins
The author and his team identified and then interviewed the exectutives at 
a number of companies that went from good businesses to great businesses, and
attempted to tease out what made them different.
